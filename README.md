# Deep Learning with Amazon SageMaker Studio


In this workshop, you’ll learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to build, train and tune deep learning models using built-in algorithms as well as custom Tensorflow code. 

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides machine learning (ML) developers and data scientists with the ability to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly. SageMaker provides you with everything you need to train and tune models at scale without the need to manage infrastructure. You can use Amazon SageMaker Studio, the first integrated development environment (IDE) for machine learning, to quickly visualize experiments and track training progress without ever leaving the familiar Jupyter Notebook interface. Within SageMaker Studio, you can use SageMaker Experiments to track, evaluate, and organize
experiments easily.


In this workshop, you’ll go through the following steps:
1. Set up Amazon SageMaker Studio to build and train your deep learning models. 
2. Download a public dataset using Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebook and upload it to Amazon S3.
3. Create an Amazon SageMaker Experiment to track and manage training jobs
4. Run Amazon SageMaker large-scale training and model tuning:
	a. Using Built-in Algorithms. 
	b. Using custom code for training with Tensorflow
5. Improve accuracy by running a large-scale Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning job to find the best model hyperparameters

You’ll be using the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a model in TensorFlow to classify images into 10 classes. This
dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images, split into 40000 images for training, 10000 images for validation
and 10000 images for testing.
